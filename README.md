# Gesture-Controlled Contactless Switch using Smartphone Camera

A final year project demonstrating gesture-based smartphone control using the device's built-in camera. The system recognizes hand gestures in real-time and maps them to common actions like unlocking the phone, launching apps, and navigating the UI â€” enabling a contactless and intuitive interaction experience.

## Features

- Real-time gesture recognition
- Works with smartphone camera (no extra hardware)
- Executes phone actions via ADB
- Offline and privacy-focused
- Simple demo interface using Streamlit

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- TensorFlow Lite
- Streamlit
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge)

## How It Works

1. Detect hand using computer vision
2. Classify gesture with a trained model
3. Trigger smartphone actions using ADB commands
4. Display interface using a Python web app

## Future Plans

- Support for dynamic gestures
- Add voice + gesture combination
- Expand to smart home devices
- Improve accuracy in low-light settings

## Disclaimer

This project was guided by external support. I am currently studying and rebuilding the components independently to deepen my understanding of computer vision and gesture interfaces.
